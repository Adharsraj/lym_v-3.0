          By leveraging data analytics, e-commerce platforms can analyze customer purchase history and browsing behavior to deliver personalized product recommendations. This enhances the customer experience by showcasing relevant products, ultimately increasing engagement and driving additional sales. For example, platforms like Amazon use purchase history and browsing behavior to recommend products that align with customers' preferences, increasing the likelihood of repeat purchases.
