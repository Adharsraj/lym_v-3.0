            approached us for help developing their digital retail store. We

            real-life interactions with this iconic British brand.

              There is so much love for the Brompton brand, owners form their
              own social clubs. And Brompton bike riders love to see their
              personality reflected through their bikes with their choice of
              colour, design and saddle. People don’t pick a Brompton, they
              design one, by taking a frame and choosing elements that appeal to
              furnish it.

                  Brompton lovers used to visit the stores and browse a
                  staggering 116 possible variations of folding bike before
                  settling on their chosen design. But when the pandemic closed
                  shops, people started buying bikes online. And with cycling
                  one of the few activities that was unrestricted, sales rose
                  steeply. Brompton recognised it was time to update their
                  website, which was six years old and designed when people
                  preferred to buy their bikes in person. As a result, the
                  ecommerce experience had not been a priority.

                We fully integrated the exploration of the bikes with the shop,
                rather than keeping them separate things. ‘Bike’ and ‘Shop’ came
                together. By thinking of marketing and ecommerce as one and the
                same, we were able to improve the experience for all Brompton
                fans.

                to learn about product lines alongside the option of buying,
                much like you’d be able to consult a store expert while browsing
                various models in real life.
